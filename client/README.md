CITY SCOUT NYC

Reason for Development:
    Being Web Development students seeking positions in New York City, we wanted to build an app that improves upon the already          existing mass of websites that "score" various neighborhoods. Where our app is different, however, is how we allow the user to        specify which things they care more or less about, so the score can reflect that. Also we wanted to visualize how that score was      composed. We used ChartsJS to show what the score for each category is and how that score was calculated. 

Current Features:
    1. Enter an address in New York City.
    2. From that address get neighborhood and a score based on data collected from NYC Open Data
    3. Alter score using preference sliders
    4. Show location on map
    5. Visualize data using ChartsJS
    
    
Planned Features and changes:
    1. More datapoints to generate a better scoring system.
    2. Separate charts to make data more readable.
    3. Outline neighborhood on map after you enter address.
    4. Add "better neighborhoods" feature which shows which neighborhoods would be a better fit for your preferences. 
    5. Save and compare searches
    6. Show rental listings within radius of target location
    7. Scoring by neighborhood in addition to by address.
    8. Compare address against the neighborhood average and boro average in addition to comparing against NYC as a whole.
